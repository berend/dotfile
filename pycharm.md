# Some notes about pycharm


This is a yet to be automated tweaking list of pycharm. I guess I could save most of it in a settings file, but this is a constant flow of tweak and I like to redo/revisit my decisions. Hence, I collect them here:


* live template for adding pdb
* line comment mapped to [cmd+#]
* Code Navigation back mapped to [alt+cmd+cursor left]
* Code Navigation forward mapped to [alt+cmd+cursor right]
* Mapped "Replace..." to [cmd + r]
*
